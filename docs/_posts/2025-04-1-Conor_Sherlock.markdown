Today we first played an icebreaker game to get to know more people and feel more comfortable. Then we went on a tour of the offices which was interesting to see all the facilities and environment the programmers work in. After that we had a talk about the history of red hat which was quite interesting. we had our first break then in which I got to know a few of the lads as we played pool and mariokart. After our break we had a talk on health and safety. we then got to go on an early lunch in which we played a small bit more pool and mariokart. After lunch we had an interesting talk on agile and scrum followed by a practical to put what we had learned into practice. We did this by using mr potato heads as our product. We were split into three teams and assigned a product owner each. The product owner gave us a theme and we had to work together to create a potato head based on the Theme. We finished the day off by getting ourselves set up on the laptops. I enjoyed today and am looking forward to the week ahead.

Today we started by writing up our blogs for Monday. We followed this by learning about python through a presentation and then putting what we had learned into practice. We were able to code a rock paper scissors game which was very interesting. We then had a presentation on hacking passwords and got a chance to give what we learnt a go on a helpful website. We followed step by step and were able to hack passwords. I enjoyed today as I learnt lots of new skills.

Today we once again started with our stand up to make sure we are all on the same page with our work. Then we worked on our blog for tuesday. Once we had wrote that up we got a talk on the history of computing which I thought was quite interesting. We worked on our cyber skills then before lunch by saving a hospital from a hacker, we played this on a fun website. After lunch we worked on our teamwork skills by splitting into teams and building a rollercoaster. I thought that this was quite a fun and worthwhile activity as we worked well together and got to practise the agile and scrum techniques. I enjoyed today and I think that I learnt a lot.
