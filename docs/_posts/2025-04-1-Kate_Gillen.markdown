** Blog details for Monday **

On Monday at 10 AM, I started my Transition Year (TY) work placement along with eight other students. The day was structured to help us settle in, get to know each other, and learn about the company.

We began the day with icebreaker activities. These helped us become more comfortable with each other and made it easier to communicate as a group the activities included 20 questions and 2 truths and 1 lie
Office Tour

After the icebreakers, we were given a tour of the office. This helped us understand the layout of the workplace and where different teams worked.

Then we had the Agile talk and we compleated the activity afterwards using poatoe heads. I was in group C and we had to make marvel theamed potatoe heads.

Lastly we tried signing into our computours but unfourtionatly the wifi wouldn't connect to my computer :[

**Blog details for Tuesday**

Yesterday was my second day of work experience at Red Hat, and it was another exciting and insightful day. I arrived at 9:15 AM, and we started by setting up our GitHub accounts to write our Monday blog post, getting familiar with version control and the open-source workflow. 

After that, we jumped into learning Python, exploring its basics and we looked at the 4 different data types integers, floats, Boolean, and strings we also did a number of exercise codes.

One of the most interesting parts of the day was working on password cracking, which gave us a glimpse into cybersecurity and ethical hacking. It was fascinating to see how weak passwords can be exploited and why strong security measures are essential.

Overall the day was a great learning experience and I loved doing new things.

**Blog details for Thursday**.

Today was another exciting day at Red Hat! We started by reflecting on our experiences from the previous day and completing our blog posts. It was a great way to document what we had learned and set the tone for the day ahead.

After breakfast, we joined a meeting with all the office staff. It was interesting to see how the team collaborates and communicates to keep everything running smoothly. Following the meeting, we had an insightful talk about Artificial Intelligence (AI), exploring its impact on technology and the world around us.

The next session introduced us to Bash scripting, a powerful coding language used for automation and system management. Learning the basics of Bash was a fun challenge, and it gave us a deeper understanding of how computers process commands.

After a well-earned lunch break, we shifted gears to work on our sustainability projects, focusing on rain gardens. These projects highlighted the importance of eco-friendly solutions and how technology can support sustainability efforts. Once we finished working on them, we took a short break before presenting our ideas to the group.

To wrap up the day, we completed our blog posts, reflecting on everything we had learned. Overall, it was a productive and engaging day full of new knowledge and hands-on experience!
